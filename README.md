This is a simple arduino script which is used for remote controlling toy cars, or in my case, it was used for remote controlling my daughters electric quadbike.

Breakdown:

Uses ESP32 ESP-NOW to control the quadbikes direction and speed.
The controller has the ability to display signal strength via LEDs and uses a joystick for control.
